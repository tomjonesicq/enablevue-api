enablevue-api
=============
The EnableVue API is intended to provide customers with an alternative to receiving their completed work via XML, JSON or alike.

The API will start out very simple, as a REST API allowing a customer to request data in this way instead of receiving a file (commonly a CSV).

Over time, the API will include features that allow for many connectivity methods and requirements based on etnerprise systems.
